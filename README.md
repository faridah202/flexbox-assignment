## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS media queries

### What I learned

I learnt how to use media queries to build a responsive and a well tailored page layout.

@media (max-width: 768px){
       row{
              flex-direction: column;
       }
       column{
              width: 170px;
       }
    }


### Continued development

My understanding of media queries and flexbox is not good yet, i would like to refine this techniques and styling in future projects.
